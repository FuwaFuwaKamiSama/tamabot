# tamabot

Basic Discord bot that responds to commands and says silly things. Current functionalities:

-Randomly generates levels from Initial D Arcade Stage 8 and Maximum Tune 5

-Really likes Evo Xs (more like the creator does)

-Pull a random picture of Tamamo no Mae or a foxgirl/wolfgirl from local directory

Future goals:

-Actively download images off PIXIV (somehow...)

-Look up prices of games (probably from pricecharting.com)

-Make a less messy method of getting list of directories (JSON file?)

-Reaction images

-Who knows
